# Organizators' Team Interview Project - HACKTUES 2023 (imgur clone)

## Frontend Disclaimer
**IMPORTANT: THE FRONT END IS NOT MINE!1!!  (IMPORTANT)

Everything that is in folder "frontend" is made from Valentin Asenov, a fellow candidate for the it organizator position. - https://github.com/alt-plus-f4/imgur

ONLY the script "server_request.js" and the templates in folder "src" are made from me to connect backend and frontend

 

This project is developed as part of the interview process for the Organizators' Team in HACKTUES 2023.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js with TypeScript for building the CRUD REST API
- Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool
- PostgreSQL as the database

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed
- PostgreSQL database setup and accessible

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```


2. Install dependencies:
```
cd <project-folder>
npm install
```


3. Set up the database:

- Create a PostgreSQL database (could be a docker).
- Create a `.env` file with your credentials.

```
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_SCHEMA=imgur
POSTGRES_USER=dummy_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dummy_password
POSTGRES_DB=dummy_db

# JWT Configuration
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=20m
JWT_SECRET=<random_data>
RESET_TOKEN_SECRET=<random_data>

# Database URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}?schema=${DB_SCHEMA}&sslmode=prefer

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_FROM_USERNAME="no-reply@example.com"
EMAIL_FROM_PASSWORD="password123"
EMAIL_SMTP="smtp.example.com"
EMAIL_PORT=587

# Cookie Configuration
COOKIE_JWT_KEY="YourCookieKey"
```
*The <random_data> should be a random string of at least 256 bytes (could use a crypto lirary for crypto.randomBits(512).toSting() or just some random text)

4. Run database migrations:
```
npx prisma migrate dev
```


5. Start the application:
- Its on 2 different apis'
     - For authentication
     - For posts/coments 
```
npm run devStart
npm run devStartAuth
```

6. The two apis' should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:4000`.
